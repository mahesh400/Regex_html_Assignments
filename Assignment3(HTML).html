				Professor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether it's the summer 
				grass that tickles your feet or the bed Bordeaux smacking on 
				your palate, nearly every part of the world around you carries 
				special chemical markers. These markers, called isotopes, can 
				tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance 
				are from where they travelled and what happened to them 
				along the way. But doing these analyses has been complex 
				and costly. Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new 
				method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.

				<td>BY CYNTHIA HAVEN L.A. Cicero Lindy Hop instruction Stanford 
				is an epicenter for the vintage dance movement --- but life in the Stanford 
				dance world is not all foxtrots and tangos. The June 26-28 Stanford's 
				Dance Weekend in Roble Gym offers something for modern dance enthusiasts, too:
				the hustle, the West Coast swing, 1970s disco hustle, Bollywood and blues fashion.
